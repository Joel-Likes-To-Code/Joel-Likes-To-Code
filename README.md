## Background

</br>

I always loved technology ever since I was young. This has led me to the world of software development. I have worked on front and back-end web applications as well as some video games. It is an absolute joy for me to learn as much as I can and there is no better field than this. The world of tech is constantly evolving and I intend to follow it as long as I can.

</br>

I graduated from Code Fellows in September of 2021 and had the joy of learning from and working beside so many talented and creative people. I learned front end development using JavaScript, React, CSS, HTML, and Git to name a few.  The final last class focused heavily on back-end development using .NET with Azure and C#. 

</br>

Since then I have been working at Code Fellows as a teaching assistant while studying more on my own to keep my skills fresh!

## Projects

Down Below I have pinned a few of my favorite projects I have worked on. 

* [Azure Skies](https://github.com/zgameboyz/CandyRollerPlayDemo) is a web application created using .NET, C#, and Azure. *Currently inactive due to Azure upkeep costs.* A user can text their flight ICAO number to the provided phone number to subscribe to the service. Our service will periodically check the flight API and return the users flight status such as Delayed, On Time, etc. 

</br>

* [Character Sonnet](https://charactersonnet.quest/) is a Dungeons and Dragons character creator created with React. It uses an API to gather the information used to populate the forms when creating a character such as the Race, Class, etc. The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Roll-Noon-A-Barbaric-Sonnet). The other members who helped create this application can be found in the repository as well. Please check them out too they are awesome!

</br>

* [Candy Roller](https://github.com/zgameboyz/CandyRollerPlayDemo) is a very special project to me. It is the first game I have ever created in unity and I worked tirelessly on it. The game was created in three days and consists of one level. I learned so much about Unity and gained a deeper understanding of C#. I had a glimpse at the true power of inheritance and the importance of encapsulation. There are a few things I would like to change and add in this game but I won't because I want to see how far I have come one day after working on some more games in my free time.
